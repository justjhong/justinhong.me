    <h1>Hello, I'm Justin Hong.</h1>
    <p>
      As of Fall 2022, I am attending Columbia University as a{" "}
      Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department. I am excited to be working with the&nbsp;
      <a href="https://www.azizilab.com/">Azizi Lab</a>. I am
      interested in developing scalable and easily interpretable computational
      methods for unraveling the complexities of biological data.
      <br />
      <br />
      Previously, I was a research engineer at the{" "}
      <a href="https://yoseflab.github.io/">Yosef Lab</a> at&nbsp;
      <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a>, where I contributed to
      open source package&nbsp;
      <a href="https://scvi-tools.org/" style={{ fontFamily: "monospace" }}>
        scvi-tools
      </a>{" "}
      for the deep-probabilistic modeling of single-cell omics data.
      <br />
      <br />
      I attended UC Berkeley for both undergraduate and graduate (M.S.)
      studies in Computer Science &#x26; Molecular and Cellular Biology. I was
      fortunate to have been advised by&nbsp;
      <a href="http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yss/">
        Professor Yun Song
      </a> and{" "}
      <a href="http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~kannanr/">
        Professor Kannan Ramchandran
      </a>{" "}
      for my Master's program, during which I developed a method for
      deconvolving bulk RNA-seq data using a single-cell RNA-seq reference
      dataset.
      <br />
      <br />
      Previously, I worked as a software engineer at{" "}
      <a href="https://www.nuro.ai/">Nuro</a> working on developing evaluation
      and introspection tools for our autonomy stack. This involved filtering
      through massive amounts of data to understand where the bot underperformed
      and tracking the performance of future software iterations on relevant
      scenarios.
